  abstract        = {We study families of polynomial dynamical systems inspired
                  by biochemical reaction networks. We focus on complex balanced
                  mass-action systems, which have also been called toric. They
                  are known or conjectured to enjoy very strong dynamical
                  properties, such as existence and uniqueness of positive
                  steady states, local and global stability, persistence, and
                  permanence. We consider the class of disguised toric dynamical
                  systems, which contains toric dynamical systems, and to which
                  all dynamical properties mentioned above extend naturally. By
                  means of (real) algebraic geometry we show that some reaction
                  networks have an empty toric locus or a toric locus of
                  Lebesgue measure zero in parameter space, while their
                  disguised toric locus is of positive measure. We also propose
                  some algorithms one can use to detect the disguised toric
                  locus.},
