  abstract        = {We study the reciprocal variety to the LSSM of
                  catalecticant matrices associated with ternary quartics. With
                  numerical tools, we obtain 85 to be its degree and 36 to be
                  the ML-degree of the LSSM. We provide a geometric explanation
                  to why equality between these two invariants is not reached,
                  as opposed to the case of binary forms, by describing the
                  intersection of the reciprocal variety and the orthogonal of
                  the LSSM in the rank loci. Moreover, we prove that only the
                  rank-$1$ locus, namely the Veronese surface ν4(P2),
                  contributes to the degree of the reciprocal variety.},
